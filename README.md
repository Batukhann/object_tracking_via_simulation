Object Tracking Via Simulation (Airsim + Unreal Engine)

First of all, Airsim and Unreal Engine installations need to be done.

There are many environments in Unreal Engine's market where this algorithm can be tested. We worked in 3 different environments on this project.

- https://www.unrealengine.com/marketplace/en-US/product/vehicle-game
- https://www.unrealengine.com/marketplace/en-US/product/landscape-mountains

After the environment is established, the object to be tracked needs to be added. We decided to initialize a car for this project. You can access the assets of the vehicle in the Assets folder.

At the same time, some parameters of the drone need to be adjusted. We shared the settings we use in the Settings folder.
